# Google Apps Script

Google Apps Script is a Google-hosted JavaScript runner with a builtin
namespace for interacting with Google products.

[See Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script)

## Getting started

[Start from the Apps Script dashboard.](https://script.google.com/home)

From there you can make a new Apps Script project.

## Google Slides

Scripts can be bound to a presentation, but don't necessarily need to be.

A script can create or access an existing presentation.
