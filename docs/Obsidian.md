# Obsidian

[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) is software for note-taking and wiki-editing. It's a glorified [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) editor (that I love ðŸ’•).

Everyone has their own note-taking methods, and unique setups. Here's some general tips I think *everyone* could benefit from.

To be a true Obsidian user, you must look up [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) at least once.

## General note guidelines

1. Add a set of [tags](#Tags) to every file. Don't bother with complicated folder structures.
2. Include full context, including links in every note.
3. Write as though you're writing it for someone else.
4. Write any proper noun that is closely related as a `[[Wikilink]]`.
5. Separate private notes somewhere else.

## Features

### Search

Searching can be done in Obsidian by entering the quick search menu with âŒ˜+Shift+F.

#### Basic rules for searches
- `meeting work` returns all pages containing **both** meeting and work.
- `meeting OR work` returns all pages containing meeting **or** work.
- `personal (meeting OR work)` returns all pages containing **both** personal **and one of** meeting or work.
- `personal -work` returns all pages containing personal and **not** work.

#### Operators

To find notes using tags, use the tag search operator like `tag:#meeting`.
To find notes with filenames, use the `file:` operator, like `file:.jpg`
To find notes with particular paths, use the `path:` operator like `Obsidian.md`

### Tags

[Tags](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Tags) are an alternate means of organising [[Obsidian]] pages outside of a nested folder structure.

Tags can be added to anywhere with the hash (#) key, like `#cool-tag` but for whole pages, they should be added to the metadata, where the hash is unnecessary.

## Plugins

### Obsidian Git

[Obsidian Git](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Start+here) is a plugin for automatically syncing an [[Obsidian]] vault to a [[Git]] repository.

To install, follow the usual steps from the Obsidian community plugin section.
