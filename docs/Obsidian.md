# Obsidian

[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) is software for note-taking and wiki-editing. It's a glorified [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) editor (that I love ðŸ’•).

Everyone has their own note-taking methods, and unique setups. Here's some general tips I think *everyone* could benefit from.

To be a true Obsidian user, you must look up [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) at least once.

## General note guidelines

1. Add a set of [tags](#Tags) to every file. Don't bother with complicated folder structures.
2. Include full context, including links in every note.
3. Write as though you're writing it for someone else.
4. Write any proper noun that is closely related as a `[[Wikilink]]`.
5. Separate private notes somewhere else.

## Features

### Search

Searching can be done in Obsidian by entering the quick search menu with âŒ˜+Shift+F.

#### Basic rules for searches
- `meeting work` returns all pages containing **both** meeting and work.
- `meeting OR work` returns all pages containing meeting **or** work.
- `personal (meeting OR work)` returns all pages containing **both** personal **and one of** meeting or work.
- `personal -work` returns all pages containing personal and **not** work.

#### Operators

To find notes using tags, use the tag search operator like `tag:#meeting`.
To find notes with filenames, use the `file:` operator, like `file:.jpg`
To find notes with particular paths, use the `path:` operator like `Obsidian.md`

### Tags

[Tags](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Tags) are an alternate means of organising [[Obsidian]] pages outside of a nested folder structure.

Tags can be added to anywhere with the hash (#) key, like `#cool-tag` but for whole pages, they should be added to the metadata, where the hash is unnecessary.

### Daily Notes

Daily notes are a great way to have a place to throw notes that don't belong anywhere in particular.
Obsidian is fantastic as a way to store working memory (relevant links, resources).

Daily notes are configurable to begin with a template in case there are things you always end up noting. They can also be configured to have a different naming convention or to automatically sort themselves into folders.

This can be done in your vault settings under **Settings â†’ Daily Notes â†’ Date format**.

*I personally recommend a format which sorts into folders. I use `YYYY/MM/Do MMMM, YYYY`, which ends up with daily notes sorted like `2024/01/1st January, 2024`*.

## Plugins

### Tasks

[Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) is a plugin for supporting to-do lists, to-do items, and querying over them.

To write a new task, it appears like this in [[Markdown]]:
```markdown
- [ ] This is task
- [ ] This is another task
- [x] This task is finished!
```

You can query over tasks, using a self-explanatory query language for example:
```
not done
due before tomorrow
sort by due reverse
```

### Obsidian Git

[Obsidian Git](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Start+here) is a plugin for automatically syncing an [[Obsidian]] vault to a [[Git]] repository.

To install, follow the usual steps from the Obsidian community plugin section.
