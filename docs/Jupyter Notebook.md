# Jupyter Notebook

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is a tool for experimenting and testing with a [[Python]] script.

To get started, you can install their bespoke tools - or an [extension for your editor of choice](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter).
Then install the `jupyter` into your virtual env.

```shell
# This will install many things.
pip install jupyter
```
