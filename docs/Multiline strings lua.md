# Multiline strings lua

Lua has "literal strings", multiline strings which do not interpret escape
codes - which are denoted by double square brackets `[[ ... ]]`.

```lua
local shop_sign = [[

===== WELCOME =====
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
]]
```

See [Programming in Lua : 2.4 strings](https://www.lua.org/pil/2.4.html)
