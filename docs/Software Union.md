# Software Unions (in Australia)

### TLDR, is it worth it?

- If you are within 2 years of graduating, or changing jobs regularly, yes it is probably worth it.
- If you are in stable employment and have no plans of changing, no it probably is not.

#### Just a _bit_ more detail

If you are within 2 years of graduating, membership fees will be around $224/year (after estimated tax deduction).
Otherwise, it'll be around $554/year (after estimated tax deduction).

Their main benefits are around workplace advice and support, and financial advice and support.

If you think within the next 12 months you will potentially need support around discrimination, rates of pay, termination, or financial advice, **AND** that support is worth the listed then you _should_ join.

To join, [follow the many links on their site](https://www.professionalsaustralia.org.au/Shared_Content/Forms/Join_Forms/JoinPA.aspx).

If you don't need those services, or don't think it's worth it, then you _shouldn't_ join.

## What is the software union?

_(In Australia ðŸ¦˜)_

Software engineers and similar roles (QA Engineer, DevOps Engineer, etc) do not have a specific union in Australia.

The closest is [Professionals Australia](https://www.professionalsaustralia.org.au/Professionals).
For people working in _defense_, and _IT (software)_, you are accommodated by the union as a whole, generically.

For people working in _game development_ or _management_, you are accommodated by the [Game Workers Division](https://gameworkers.professionalsaustralia.org.au/Gameworkers/About_us/Game_Workers/Content/About_us.aspx?hkey=ed658304-2d45-4f0e-8d3f-e38c36aac577) and ["Other Managers and Professionals" Division](https://www.professionalsaustralia.org.au/Professionals/Content/Structure_Professionals/Divisions_Groups/Managers_Professionals.aspx?Code=FED-MPD&GroupID=COMMITTEE/FED-MPD).

:::tip
that even without joining, you still have free access to some of their resources like the [Renumeration Report](http://apesma.informz.net/apesma/data/images/2021-22%20ICT%20Employment%20and%20Remuneration%20Report.pdf).

They also provide support for salary negotiation.
