# ECMAScript

ECMAScript is a standard for a general-purpose programming language developed and maintained by [Ecma International](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/), which is a non-profit organization.

ECMA stands for European Computer Manufacturers Association.

ECMAScript is literally just a specification. It is implemented into [[JavaScript]], which is a web scripting language.

## Proposals

Any changes made to ECMAScript are done using proposals. Proposals are registered in [the tc39 GitHub repository](https://github.com/tc39/proposals).
