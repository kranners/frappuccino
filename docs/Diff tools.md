# Diff tools

[Delta (git-delta)](https://github.com/dandavison/delta)

- Nice looking diffs
- Text parsing algorithm
- More stable, known, many existing integrations

[difftastic](https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic)

- Parses with Treesitter first, so you get some nutty diffs
- [Noted bad performance & bad stability](https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic#known-issues)
- New so not as well supported yet
