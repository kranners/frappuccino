# AGS

AGS (Aylur's GTK Shell) is a scaffolding CLI for building desktop shells
written in [Astal](https://aylur.github.io/astal/).

Using AGS, you can make entire desktop "shells", involving all the usual bits
and pieces, bars, panels, docks, etc.
For example, Aylur has created [the Marble shell.](https://marble-shell.pages.dev/)

See [AGS](https://aylur.github.io/ags/)

## What is this, exactly?

You're so funny, wanting to _know things_. Weirdo.

There's a [GNOME C-library called GObject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GObject),
which allows for writing object-oriented C-libraries and then creating bindings 
for those C-libraries in whatever language you want.

The creation of bindings is handled by a middleware layer called
[GObject Introspection](https://gi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

[GJS is then a set of JavaScript bindings](https://gjs-docs.gnome.org/gjs/), generated by GObject Introspection, for the GTK C library.

Astal is a library for making desktop widgets, written in C [and Vala](https://vala.dev/),
using GObject Introspection, bindings are available for it for JavaScript using GJS.

[AGS is a CLI](https://aylur.github.io/ags/) for generating
and working with projects made in Astal and JavaScript.
