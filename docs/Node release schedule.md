# Node release schedule

:::info
**TLDR**: [Get the latest LTS from the Node homepage.](https://nodejs.org/en)

Even numbers = stable and supported for 2.5 years.
:::

Node uses a two-track release cycle, odd numbers are considered unstable and even numbers are considered stable.

Typically odd-numbered versions will be considered the _Current release_ for 6 months.
After six months, they become unsupported and its' even-numbered successor moves to _Active LTS_, and is ready for use.

LTS means _long term support_, and typically means critical bugfixes for about 30 months (2.5 years).

## Feature stability

Different APIs are in different stages of development at any given time.

For production, you'll want to use APIs with a stability of `2 - Stable` or greater.

For personal stuff, go crazy go stupid ðŸ¤ª.
