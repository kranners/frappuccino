# About

![Coffee cup notebook](/cup.png)

[This wiki](index) is a collection of my personal notes for various things, mostly development.

It is [automatically updated and deployed](https://github.com/kranners/frappuccino/actions) as I write new notes.

It's called Frappuccino because I name all my [[Obsidian]] vaults after coffee.

### Beware

I like to write links to pages that may not exist yet, but will probably exist in the future.

Links **WILL** be broken.

### Flamingos

thanks for checking it out :)
