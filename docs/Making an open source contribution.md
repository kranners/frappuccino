# Making an open source contribution

_You cannot make a branch on a repository you do not have push access to._

Typically, making an open source contribution looks like:

1. Read their README and CONTRIBUTING documents, as well as any developer
   documentation.

2. Make a fork of the repository under your own user or organisation.

3. Set up the project as directed by the documentation.

4. Make a new branch in your fork, make the changes there.

5. Make a pull request from your new branch, following the documentation.
