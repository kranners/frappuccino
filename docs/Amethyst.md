# Amethyst

[Amethyst is a tiling window manager for MacOS](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst) which exists inside the normal
MacOS window manager. 

This means that it doesn't require System Integrity Protection to be disabled,
unlike alternatives like yabai.

## Configuration

Amethyst's config is stored at `~/.amethyst.yml` or `~/.config/amethyst/amethyst.yml`.

[An example config can be found on the Amethyst repo](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst/blob/development/.amethyst.sample.yml)

[Or there's a set of configuration keys on the repo too.](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst/blob/development/docs/configuration-files.md)
