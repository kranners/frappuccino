# Wayland

[Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) is a windowing system protocol and specification which is intended to replace the [[X11]] server protocol.

Wayland is not itself a program which you can run. It is like [[ECMAScript]] to [[JavaScript]].

### Compositors

A display server which implements the Wayland protocol is called a *compositor*.

Some examples of existing compositors:

- [**weston**](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston) - A small, sample implementation of a Wayland compositor.
- [**sway**](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) - The de facto standard Wayland compositor, based on i3.
- [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) - A newer, more [questionably developed compositor](https://drewdevault.com/2023/09/17/Hyprland-toxicity.html).
