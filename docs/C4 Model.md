# C4 Model

The C4 model is a set of abstractions and diagrams for visualising software architecture.

See [the C4 model](https://c4model.com/)

### System context diagram

The system context diagram is the first starting point, where you express the very top-level systems.

A "software system" doesn't mean a program. It means any number of programs which come together to form a system, that does a thing.

#### Example

If you have a single website that features a store and a blog, a backend to handle payments, a database to hold the blog content, and an administration portal for managing the store, then

You could argue that you have two systems, a Store and a Blog. That's all.
