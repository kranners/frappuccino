# Disabling or enabling Github Actions workflows

Disabling a workflow is done via the GitHub web UI or CLI.

For the web UI, this is done through the Actions tab of a repository:
- into the specific action
- then the triple dot menu
- then Disable workflow

See [Disabling and enabling a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow)
See [[GitHub Actions]]
