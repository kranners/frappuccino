# Alerts in Markdown

[For GitHub flavored Markdown, you can use:](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925)
```
> [!NOTE]  
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

> [!TIP]
> Optional information to help a user be more successful.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]  
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

> [!CAUTION]

```

Each alert has a title and a corresponding color, eg. warning is orange, and note is blue.
