# Japanese Math Terms

I used these exactly once for a karate class I taught, trying to get students to do 2-digit equations in Japanese. It had mixed success :)

### General terms
keesan no kotoba (words of math)  
itte kudasai (please try to say these)  

### Operators
- `+` tasu
- `-` hiku
- `÷` waru
- `×` kakeru
- `=` wa

### Shi vs Yon vs Nana vs Shichi
Shi & shichi are 'onyomi', older and derived from classical Chinese  
し (shi) sounds a lot like 死 (shi) which means death.

Yon & nana are 'kunyomi', newer and native Japanese pronunciation.
4 yon
7 nana
100 hyaku
1000 sen

### Fractions and decimals
Fraction (bun no) ie. 1/2 is 2 bun no 1, ni bun no ich.
  
Decimals are read out in all their numbers each like 3 dot 7 5.
3.75 = san "ten" nana go

### Putting them together
5432 = gosenyonhyakusanjuni
  
"9x9=81" kyu kakeru kyu wa hachijuichi
  
342 × 1/100 = 3.42 is
"san hyaku yon ju ni kakeru hyaku bun no ichi wa san ten yon ni"
