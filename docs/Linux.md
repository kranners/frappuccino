# Linux

[Linux](https://www.linux.org/) is an [operating system kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) ostensibly developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NPllzkFhE), a funny computer man.

For more info on where kernels sit in the scheme of things, the [[Arch Linux]] build steps may help out. Particularly the section on [setting up a bootloader](#Arch%20Linux#Setting%20up%20a%20boot%20loader).

### Distributions

There's an endless amount of distributions. Here's some I have pages on:
- [[Arch Linux]]
- [[NixOS]]
