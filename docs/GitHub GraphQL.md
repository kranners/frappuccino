# GitHub GraphQL

[GitHub provides a GraphQL API as well as the older REST API.](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql)

[The GitHub docs has a page comparing the two, but it boils down to:](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/about-the-rest-api/comparing-githubs-rest-api-and-graphql-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28)
- REST APIs return more data than what you need, but are simpler to use.
- GraphQL APIs return exactly what you requested, but are more difficult to use.
- _"Occasionally, a feature may be supported on one API but not the other."_

For usage information, check out [[Octokit GraphQL]]
