# Widget Toolkits

A [widget toolkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_toolkit) is a library which provides components to build graphical applications.

**NOTE:** They are not, themselves, programs which run. They're just libraries for other programs to build upon. They do however, need to be installed as packages to work correctly.

Linux applications typically use either [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) or [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) as their widget toolkit of choice.

### GTK

GTK (the GIMP Toolkit) was initially released by The GNU Project in April 1998, shortly before the release of [GIMP](https://www.gtk.org/) itself.

All [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) programs use GTK.

Software using GTK include:
- [WebKit](https://webkitgtk.org/)
- [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/)
- [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/)

### Qt

Qt (say it like Q-T, or else) was initially released by then Trolltech, now The Qt Company in 1995.

**SIDENOTE:** It's called *"Qt"* because one of the founders liked the letter Q. The *"t"* more-or-less stands for *toolkit*. The Qt Company was called Quasar Technologies before it was even incorporated, then it was renamed to Trolltech. This company has had a ton of names.

All [KDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE_Projects) projects use Qt.

Software using Qt include:
- [FileZilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE_Projects)
- [Mumble](https://www.mumble.info/)
- [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)
