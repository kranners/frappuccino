# DisplayLink

[DisplayLink](https://www.synaptics.com/products/displaylink-graphics/downloads/macos) is software for enabling Dell docks on [[MacOS]].

It can be downloaded [from their website](https://www.synaptics.com/products/displaylink-graphics/downloads/macos), but a [[Homebrew]] cask also exists (although not maintained by Dell).

```shell
brew install --cask displaylink
```
